title: Error handling

# Error handling

Errors might occur for various reasons. Robust applications shall handle them and not assume that each API call will succeed.

## HTTP status codes

As usual in REST APIs errors are returned as HTTP status codes. The documentation for each API call lists all possible errors which might occur.

<table class="table">
	<thead><tr><th>Error code</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>200</td><td>OK</td><td>Request succeded</td></tr>
		<tr><td>201</td><td>Created</td><td>A new resource was created</td></tr>
		<tr><td>202</td><td>Accepted</td><td>Request will be processed but isn't finished yet</td></tr>
		<tr><td>304</td><td>Not Modified</td><td>Is returned if the request had the If-None-Match header and the ETag on the resource was the same.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>400</td><td>Bad request</td><td>The request was not formated as expected or missing parameters</td></tr>
		<tr><td>401</td><td>Unauthorized</td><td>Authorization failed</td></tr>
		<tr><td>403</td><td>Forbidden</td><td>The caller has no rights to access the requested URI</td></tr>
		<tr><td>404</td><td>Resource Not Found</td><td>The requested resource (light, group, ...) was not found</td></tr>
		<tr><td>503</td><td>Service Unavailable</td><td>The device is not connected to the network or too busy to handle further requests</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## JSON error objects

Further details of the errors are available as JSON object in the response body.

	{
		"error": {
			"type": <error code>,
			"address": <ressource/parameter>,
			"description": <description>
		}
	}

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>type</td>
      <td>Number</td>
      <td>One of the error codes listed below.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>address</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>The url which refers to the resource/parameter which caused the error.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>description</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>The error description contains details on what went wrong.</td>
    </tr>
